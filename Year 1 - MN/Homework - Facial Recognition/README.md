# Facial Recognition using Singular Values Decomposition

The files labeled task%d.m contain mostly graphic generating functions in order to understand the use of SVD.
The files eigenface_core.m and face_recognition.m contain functions which based on a dataset of images conatining human faces, can determine if a given image is also that of a face.
In order to do so, it uses SVD to find enough similarities between the dataset and the image.

I have also included the graphics resulted from task2.m and task5.m in graphics.pdf.
